'''
We are given a list of "n" unit conversions. Each conversion represents how to
convert one "metric" to another.

For example, the following represents a unit conversion:
1m = 100cm

Now, given a series of "n" unit conversions, such as â€¦
1m = 100cm
6ft = 1.83m
3yard = 9ft
180in = 5yard
â€¦

We need to answer "q" queries - each query will be asking to do a conversion.
For example:
55 yards in cm -> (5029)
21 m in km -> NA

Sequence of input/outputs

INFO: 6ft = 1.83m
INFO: 3ft = 1yar


input:
1m = 100cm
1ft = 2.1m


q: 1ft = ?cm

const inp = [
  { from: { val: 1, unit: 'm' }, to: { val: 100, unit: 'cm' } },
  { from: { val: 1.83, unit: 'm' }, to: { val: 6, unit: 'ft' } },
];



{ from: 'cm', to: 'ft' }

convertUnits( q, inputs ) => output (number/NA)
